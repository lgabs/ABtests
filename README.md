# Analysis of Conversion Rates

## Project 3 in the course of Data Science 2 (Udacity)

In this project, we carry on a "A/B test" in Python (on Jupyter Notebook) to investigate whether or not a new page should be implemented over an old one (used as control group), based on the measure of which page "converts" more, i.e, which page get to make more users click on the desired button (it can happen for a lot of reasons, like the design of the page, colors etc). The data contains information about a lot of observations of users in both pages, as well as conversion rate. 

The A/B Test is structured first manually, then the `statsmodels` library is used to reproduce the same conclusions. After that, a regression approach with logistic regression is done in order to compare with A/B tests.
